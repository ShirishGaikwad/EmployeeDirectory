## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Xcode
3. Add your `employees.json` to the app bundle (see sample below)
4. Run the app in the Simulator or on your device

## JSON Format

Sample for `employees.json`:
```json
{
  "employees": [
    {
      "id": "EMP001",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "jobTitle": "Software Engineer",
      "department": "Engineering",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "phoneNumber": "123-456-7890",
      "hireDate": "2020-01-15",
      "salary": 75000,
      "isManager": false,
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "state": "CA",
        "zip": "12345"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "EMP002",
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "jobTitle": "Product Manager",
      "department": "Product",
      "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
      "phoneNumber": "987-654-3210",
      "hireDate": "2019-06-01",
      "salary": 90000,
      "isManager": true,
      "address": {
        "street": "456 Broadway",
        "city": "Somecity",
        "state": "NY",
        "zip": "10001"
      }
    }
  ]
`````

## Usage

- Run the app. The employee list will load from either the bundled JSON or a dropped file.
- Select an employee to see details, including name, job, contact, and address info.
- Use file-drop to update the employee list at runtime (supported formats: JSON text, file URLs).
